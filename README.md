The main website is built to provide information about tourist attractions in Vietnam.

Once logged into the system, users can search or view relevant information and services about tourist destinations, as well as photos and comments posted by other users to promote that tourist destination. At the same time, users are also allowed to post photos, comment on their own experiences about places, and save locations and services for later viewing.

The service group that provides tourism services (hotels) has the same system access rights as Tourists. At the same time, this group can also add, edit and delete information about their services.

The Administrators group will manage the user's accounts, manage the tourist attractions as well as the news or types of services that the Service Group provides.
